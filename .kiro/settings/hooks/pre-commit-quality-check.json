If so, verify they are latest stable versions and well-maintained.\n2. **Code Quality**: Look for duplicate files with suffixes like '_fixed', '_clean', '_backup' - flag these as violations.\n3. **File Management**: Ensure clean directory structure and consistent naming conventions.\n4. **Documentation**: Check if changes require README updates or inline documentation.\n5. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Scan for API keys, passwords, or sensitive data.\n\nProvide a summary of findings with:\n- ✅ Passed checks\n- ⚠️ Warnings (should fix but not blocking)\n- ❌ Violations (must fix before commit)\n\nIf violations exist, suggest specific fixes.",
